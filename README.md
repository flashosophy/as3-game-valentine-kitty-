# as3-game-valentine-kitty-
This is the web source code for game http://www.cutecatgames.com/games/valentinekitty/ I made in actionscript 3 back in 2012.

How to play:  Left or right arrow keys, or click left or right of the cat.  Collect coins and roses, avoid falling items.

Notes:  The wall of love is disabled for the web version.  I think it still works on mobile iOS though.

This game uses the following technologies: 

Starling http://gamua.com/starling/

Citrus Engine http://citrusengine.com/

DragonBones http://dragonbones.github.io/

Mochi Ads (closed down)

Nape physics engine
