# as3-game-valentine-kitty-
This is the web source code for game http://www.cutecatgames.com/games/valentinekitty/ I made in actionscript 3 back in 2012.

This game uses the following technologies: 
Starling http://gamua.com/starling/
Citrus Engine http://citrusengine.com/
DragonBones http://dragonbones.github.io/
Mochi Ads (closed down)
Nape physics engine

Notes:  The wall of love is disabled for the web version.  I think it still works on mobile iOS though.
